# Privacy focused browsers 

When it comes to alternatives for common apps on Android, browsers take the cake, there are a lot of good options that work and offer their own functions, as well as dozens of them which are forks with ads, or simply malicious.
But if you want to be safe on the internet, there are just a few trustworthy options: Bromite, and Fennec.
You could open it a bit and allow others like Brave, Vivaldi, or Duck Duck Go, but you should choose one of the first two if you really want the maximum amount of security and control, right?.

Well, maybe. But the reality is, that more often than not those browser are just too heavy for the simple things. And by that I mean, when opening that are shared on social media, or inside an app, or just something simple like that.
