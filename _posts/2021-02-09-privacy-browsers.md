When it comes to alternatives for common apps on Android, browsers take the cake, there are a lot of good options that work and offer their own functions, as well as dozens of them which are forks with ads, or simply malicious.
But if you want to be safe on the internet, there are just a few trustworthy options: Bromite, and Fennec.
You could open it a bit and allow others like Brave, Vivaldi, or Duck Duck Go, but you should choose one of the first two if you really want the maximum amount of security and control, right?.

Well, maybe. But the reality is, that more often than not those browser are just too heavy for the simple things. And by that I mean, opening links that are shared on social media, or inside an app, or a quick visit to the full site from your RSS reader.

On a personal experience, Fennec has proven to be quite slow *at opening links*, at least when I enable add-ons like UBlock Origin or Dark reader. However it works perfectly fine if I porpusefuly use the browser. I really dont uinderstand why, and even if I did, I dont see the point in opening a full 60 Mb+ app.

So I started looking for light browsers, based on WebView and so. Since I am using a custom rom, my device comes with Via preinstalled.
