# About android launchers and customization

## How everything started

I have always liked the freedom that Android can give u as an operating system, ever since I got that first weird Chinese phone my mother got from a random store with no warranty at all and a battery that was about to explode, I fell in love with how different I could make my phone look compared to everyone else's just by installing a few apps in those 512 mb of storage.

At the time, I watched videos from the spanish youtube channel [Pro Android](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndroideReview) wich showcased different launchers and apps to customize my device.
However, I had android 2.3, wich was already old at the time, and even tho I rooted my device (or I thought I did, I probabaly got a virus or something) most launchers, including Nova Launcher, did not run at all. so I had to settle on Holo Launcher.

It was not until my third phone, where I finally managed to get wild with the customization I got, a Samsung Galaxy s3 mini, with rom support and every app I wanted working because of that. I might talk about that in future.

## Android customization today
I want to focus my first blog on a poll I did, that is still going on Mastodon [here](https://fosstodon.org/@joeligj12/105670230157355847) and talk about my opinions on some of the launchers I've used over the years.

### Nova Launcher

Everyone should know this one, it has been my go-to ever since I got it, as a teenager I was unable to buy it, and my family wasn't willing to pay for apps, but it was the first thing I got when I finally got some money from Google Rewards.
It has every function you can imagine. It's gesture system is like no other, and the new gestures on icons and folders, allows me to have run up to three apps, from a single icon, by tapping it, or swiping up or down. I can make it even better if I apply the same gestures to a folder, so with a single icon, I get to access any app I want.
