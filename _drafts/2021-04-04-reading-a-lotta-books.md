It has been a very **long** time since I have properly read a book. I have always been an avid fan of reading as a hobby and as a good habit that's worth having, it's even on my [about](/about) page listened among the hobbies I have.

Nevertheless, it had been a while since I've read a proper book which is also new to me. Yeah I reread some stuff or take a quick look at some pages of old favorites. But in all honesty, I just felt like I did not have the time.

However, the Easter vacation period started, and we travelled to visit some family. Obviously, we would not be able to go out all day and most of the time was spent watching movies or YouTube videos (at least this time).

But, besides all of that, I had decided I wanted to read, I am not really sure why, but I remembered I had  not read a series a friend recommended me: [Bobiverse](/bobiverse). So I decided to give it a try. I had not read anything, I did not look for any reviews, all I knew was that my friend's nickname was Bobiverse too, so he had to like it quite a lot (Just like how I love Chrono Trigger, best SNES game indeed, @ me I don't care).

The series is about a nerdy developer who gets his head frozen and turned into an AI 100+ years into the future. It feels quite grounded in reality and I really recommend it a lot. However, this is not a review, I might do one in the future, once I read the whole thing and let it process and bit more.

According to my Screen Time, during my first week of vacation, *I spent 30+ hours reading, completing 3 of the 4 books of the Bobiverse's series, totaling around 700 pages*. And this week I will keep reading the 4th book, which has aroundd 400 pages. 

I am not saying all of this to brag or anything, I know people who read more as well as people who don't care. The point is, I had never read so much in such a short amount of time, had I?

# A long time ago...

I started to think and remember previous situations and moments where I had read, the titles of many books went throu my mind. I already knew what was my favorite genre, but I really never stopped to think about how much I preferred it.

>_**Science Fiction**_

Yeah, I finally, fully realized it. I used to think "Of course, I *like* sci-fi, but I have read a lot of other genres and kinds of books!". *Not really*.
Of course, I have read a few pages of books I read at school, or smaller pieces of 60 pages or so, but I can't really name any. Books I enjoy?, Star Wars, Halo, 20,000 Leagues Unser the Sea, The Time Machine... yeah *sci-fi*.
