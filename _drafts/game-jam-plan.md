# Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1

I have decided to doing this game jam and not tell anyone about it. I want to try and convince myself of getting to work on something, just like I have done with my blog.

## Game Theme: "Stronger Together"

The theme has the following definitions.

#### Stronger: 

* Having, showing, or able to exert great bodily or muscular power; physically vigorous or robust: *a strong boy.*

* accompanied or delivered by great physical, mechanical, etc., power or force: *a strong handshake; With one strong blow the machine stamped out a fender.*

* mentally powerful or vigorous: *He may be old, but his mind is still strong.*

* especially able, competent, or powerful in a specific field or respect: *She's very strong in mathematics. He's weak at bat, but he's a strong fielder.*

* of great moral power, firmness, or courage: *strong under temptation*.

#### Together:
* into or in one gathering, company, mass, place, or body: to call the people together.
* into or in union, proximity, contact, or collision, as two or more things: to sew things together.
* into or in relationship, association, business, or agreement, etc., as two or more persons: *to bring strangers together.*
* taken or considered collectively or conjointly: This one cost more than all the others together.
* (of a single thing) into or in a condition of unity, compactness, or coherence: *to squeeze a thing together; The argument does not hold together well.*

### Game Ideas:

* A snake kinda game
* An Agar.io kind of game
* A space shooter where you fuse with different spaceships and become a huge OP ship

* I have to find a game where I can grow in size, or in length, but without going towards adding more difficulty when doing so.

* The game should feel easier, the more together the elements are.
* A game focused on Mario Odyssey Goombas mechanics.

### Current choice

A game focused on Mario Odyssey Goombas mechanics.

Each node, or character inside of that tower of Goombas can do certain things.

#### Character ideas:

* A sum of characters can be heavy enough to activate press buttons.
* One character can split the group into two
* One character can move while having people around.
* One character can hold objects on the top of its head (They don't have arms, and are rounded, only it can gold stuff, but not other characters while holding stuff)
