# 👤 About me 
Hello! I am Joel, I am just a simple man who likes tech, FOSS and many other things. I was born in **Mexico** where I still live. I am currently studying **Mechatronics Engineering**. Here are some quick things about me:

I use Linux, and the distribution currently installed on my computer is [Void Linux.](https://voidlinux.org) 

My current smartphone is using [Arrow OS](https://arrowos.net/), as custom rom, but I switch roms from time to time. I am interested on switchin to LineageOS soon or maybe not, depending on my laziness.

I can solve a Rubik's cube in less than 20 seconds, my record is of 9.81 seconds.

I have made some videogames using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org), but I am still not that advanced in my opinion. I have participated in around 4 game jams, some of which were successful. You can play them check them on my itch.io profile or access them directly on my [front page](/).

# 📰 About this page

This page was the result of going into Mastodon and getting inspired by the Fosstodon community to start my own blog. Here I can share my thoughts without having to give away too much of me to companies such as Google or Facebook.

I have used Jekyll to generate this site, and I use simple.css as a framework, where I have customized the style to fit my taste.

The website source is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/joelchrono12/jekyll-site-test.css) and the site itself is deployed using Netlify.
