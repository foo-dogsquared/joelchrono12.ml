Hello! I am Joel, I am just a simple man who likes tech, FOSS and many other things.

I use Linux, currently using [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org) as my distro of choice, my current smartphone is using [MSM Extended](https://msmxtended.org/), but I switch roms on a monthly basis. 

I can solve a Rubik's cube in less than 20 seconds, I have made some videogames using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org), you can play them [here](https://igchrono.itch.io/) but they are not the best thing ever, I am still proud of them. 

I really like card magic,retro gaming, origami, playing and listening to music, as well as learning new techy stuff.
